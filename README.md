# Alzheimers_Disease_Prediction
Built a lightweight neural network with 3 convolutional layer and a fully connected dense layer for classifying the MRI brain images into 4 catagories i.e., Mild Demented, Very Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, Non Demented.
This project leverages the Mendeley Alzheimer’s Disease Image Dataset to build a deep learning pipeline for Alzheimer’s disease prediction. The dataset contains 6,400 MRI images categorized into 4 classes, and the pipeline includes data preprocessing, augmentation, balancing, and model evaluation.
